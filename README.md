# BankJavaPro Assignment Sascha Vis - 0962873

If you are done reading the README you can go back to the terminal and go on with the program

In this project I create a simple bank GUI for my school assignment. This will be a simple simulation of how a bank will work.

Run the project by clicking the run.bat Batch file.

Bank accounts:

| Name  | PinCode  | Starting Balance | AccountNumber       |
|:------|:--------:|-----------------:|:-------------------:|
| Piet  |   0000   |  100             | NL01BANK0123456789  |
| Henk  |   1234   |  1000            | NL01BANK9876543210  |
| Klaas |   4321   |  1000000         | NL01BANK0000000000  |

+ The Bank accounts are stored in a HashMap with the AccountNumber as a key.
+ After logging in you can withdraw or see your balance
+ The AccountNumber is your card number and that is the value that needs to be put in the Terminal
